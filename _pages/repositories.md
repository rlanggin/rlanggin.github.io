## Getting Started with Python for Physics & Astronomy

Whether you're a student or curious learner, this set of tutorials is designed to help you build programming skills for real scientific applications. These notebooks include examples drawn from introductory astronomy and physics college courses.

Follow the [Beginning Python Tutorials](https://github.com/rlanggin/Beginning_Python_Notebooks) below to start coding right away.

## Coming Soon (Fall 2025)

I am actively building more student-friendly tutorials on topics like:

- Understanding Gravitational Waves using basic high school physics
- Exploring Gravitational Wave Detectors â€” current observatories and future detectors
- Simulating Gravitational Waveforms and an introduction to Bayesian Parameter Estimation
  
These resources will grow over time as part of a local student-led collaboration, helping more learners discover Gravitational-Wave astrophysics through code.

If you'd like to contribute, or are interested in hosting these tutorials in your own classroom, feel free to [reach out](mailto:rachel.langgin@unlv.edu)!

Stay tuned!
