I am motivated by questioning every possibility; driven by a curiosity to understand our Universe on extragalactic scales through astrophysical research. That is why I am excited as a second-year graduate Astronomy PhD student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with my advisor, Dr. Carl-Johan Haster. I am researching binary compact objects through gravitational waveform interpretations and new analysis tools for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory's (LIGO) ongoing fourth data run.

Upon graduating from Bryn Mawr College with my major in Astrophysics at Haverford College and minor in Dance at Bryn Mawr, my undergraduate senior thesis focused on a spectral analysis of red and blue quasars and their effect on galactic evolution with Dr. Eilat Glikman at Middlebury College.

My interests in dance are rooted in my childhood study of voice attending the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts. I aim to broaden my artistic capabilities while implementing movement in space and time from a unique physical perspective in my daily practices.
