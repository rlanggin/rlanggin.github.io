I am motivated by questioning every possibility, driven by a curiosity to understand our Universe on extragalactic scales through astrophysical research. I am currently an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, working with my advisor, Dr. Carl-Johan Haster and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. I study binary black holes and neutron stars through the stretching and squeezing of spacetime caused by passing Gravitational Waves. 

My research focuses on analyzing waveform inaccuracies for current detectors like LIGO and planned observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. In addition, I am involved in an early-warning project for binary neutron star mergers to support timely electromagnetic follow-up within multi-messenger astronomy.

Upon graduating from Bryn Mawr College with a major in Astrophysics at Haverford College and a minor in Dance at Bryn Mawr, my undergraduate senior thesis focused on a spectral analysis of red and blue quasars and their effect on galactic evolution, conducted with Dr. Eilat Glikman at Middlebury College and Dr. Karen Masters at Haverford College.

Outside of research, my interests in dance are rooted in my childhood study of voice at the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts. I aim to broaden my artistic capabilities while exploring movement in space and time from a unique physical perspective in my daily practices.
