On July 23, I joined MGM Group’s annual **Back-to-School “Out of This World”** event held in the Vista Ballroom at the Flamingo Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Organized by MGM Resorts’ community engagement team, the event brought together local organizations and families for a day of interactive science and educational activities designed to celebrate the upcoming school year through the lens of space exploration.

As a representative of the **Nevada Center for Astrophysics** and **UNLV Department of Physics and Astronomy**, I hosted a table with my collegues sharing information about Gravitational-Waves, space science, and physics opportunities at UNLV. With support from my **APS Forum on Early Career Scientists (FOEP) Mini-Grant**, I provided a UNLV Physics and Astronomy tablecloth, custom stickers, and outreach materials for students and families. I also partnered with the **UNLV Admissions Office** to offer prospective-student resources and UNLV-themed giveaways.

A highlight of the day was sharing my **tabletop interferometer demonstration**, which allowed students to see how laser interference patterns change in real time—offering a simple introduction to the same principles behind **LIGO’s** Gravitational-Wave detectors. I also distributed copies of <a href="https://rachellanggin.com/blog/2025/gw_comic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my short comic book on Gravitational-Waves</a>, which uses storytelling and art to introduce the concept of spacetime ripples and next-generation observatories.

Throughout the event, families engaged with UNLV’s materials, asked thoughtful questions about space and physics, and shared enthusiasm for astronomy and science education. The interactive booths, games, and themed activities made for an inspiring afternoon of community engagement and outreach.

I’m deeply grateful to **MGM Group** and the organizers for inviting our research group to share Gravitational-Wave science with local students and families. Events like this are a wonderful reminder of how science outreach can spark curiosity, connect communities, and inspire the next generation of scientists.
