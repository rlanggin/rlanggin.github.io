Exciting news! My first-author paper on gravitational waveform accuracy requirements for current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors is almost finished and will be coming out soon!

To celebrate, I created a comic book inspired by this research. The comic dives into the discovery of gravitational-waves, exploring how precise waveform models are essential for unraveling the mysteries of black hole and neutron star mergers.

What’s in the comic?

- An introduction to gravitational-waves: ripples in spacetime from merging compact objects

- How waveforms act as nature’s signature, encoding the secrets of black holes and neutron stars

- Why accuracy is critical for detectors like Advanced LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA and next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer

I wanted to make this topic accessible and engaging for everyone—scientists, science enthusiasts, and students alike!

Stay tuned for the release of the paper.
