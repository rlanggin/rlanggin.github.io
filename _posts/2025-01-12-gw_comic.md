🌌 Exciting news! My first-author paper on gravitational waveform accuracy requirements for current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors is coming out soon!

To celebrate, I created a comic book inspired by this research. 🎨📖 The comic dives into the fascinating world of gravitational waves, exploring how precise waveform models are essential for unraveling the mysteries of black hole and neutron star mergers.

📡 What’s in the comic?

A journey through the cosmic symphony of merging compact objects 🌌
How waveforms are the “music scores” of the universe 🎼
Why accuracy is critical for detectors like Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and next-gen observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer 🔭
I wanted to make this complex topic accessible and engaging for everyone—scientists and science enthusiasts alike!

Stay tuned for the release of the paper. 🚀
