ðŸŒŒ Exciting news! My first-author paper on gravitational waveform accuracy requirements for current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors is coming out soon!

To celebrate, I created a comic book inspired by this research. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“– The comic dives into the fascinating world of gravitational waves, exploring how precise waveform models are essential for unraveling the mysteries of black hole and neutron star mergers.

ðŸ“¡ Whatâ€™s in the comic?


An introduction to gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime from merging compact objects ðŸŒŒ


How waveforms act as natureâ€™s signature, encoding the secrets of black holes and neutron stars âœ¨


Why accuracy is critical for detectors like Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ðŸ”­


I wanted to make this complex topic accessible and engaging for everyoneâ€”scientists, science enthusiasts, and students alike!

Stay tuned for the release of the paper. ðŸš€
