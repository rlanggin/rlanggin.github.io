On **November 5, 2025**, the **GW Explorer Volunteer Crew** hosted an afterschool **Gravitational-Wave Workshop** at the **Las Vegas Academy of the Arts**, led by **Mrs. Teresa Prezgay’s** advanced mathematics students. The workshop introduced students to **Gravitational-Wave science** through interactive notebooks, a tabletop interferometer demonstration, and discussions about how math connects to astrophysics.

The **GW Explorer Project** is designed to make Gravitational-Wave astronomy accessible to students at the high school and early undergraduate level. By combining hands-on experiments with interactive Jupyter notebooks, the project helps students build intuition about how detectors like **LIGO**, **Virgo**, and **KAGRA** measure distortions in spacetime.

## Workshop Highlights

The workshop began with introductions from the volunteer crew and a group photo with the students.

Students explored the **GW Explorer Notebook 1 (NB1)** — a guided activity that visualizes how gravitational waves are generated and detected. With help from volunteers, students connected the theory of waves in spacetime to measurable changes in distance using a **tabletop laser interferometer**, mirroring the basic principle behind real observatories.

## Binary Black Holes in Action

The session concluded with an interactive visualization of a **binary black hole inspiral**, showing how Gravitational-Wave signals evolve as two massive objects merge.

After experiencing the binary black hole animation, students dove into hands-on experiments with the **tabletop interferometer**, observing how gravitational waves cause tiny, measurable shifts in distance. Volunteers guided them step by step, linking theory from NB1 to real-world physics.

## Connecting Past and Future

This particular workshop held a special meaning: the class was taught by **Mrs. Teresa Prezgay**, who also happened to be my **former calculus teacher** at Las Vegas Academy. Years ago, I gave my first math-related presentation in her class—on astrophysics—after a simple online search for “careers that use math.” That small assignment set me on the path toward Gravitational-Wave research.

Now, one of her current students, **Bradlee Tejeda**, is part of our research team studying early-warning signals from neutron star mergers. Watching Bradlee help lead the same kind of classroom activity that once inspired me was a reminder of how mentorship and curiosity can ripple through generations.
