After the August stargazing LVAS event, I was invited back by Mig Ponce (President of LVAS) and Keith Caceres (LVAS Event Director) to present my research at the Dale Etheridge Planetarium, College of Southern Nevada for the LVAS September monthly meeting.

It was great meeting Ty Hummons (left) and Aly (right of me), and lovely to see Marcus (right second row) and Keith Caceres (far right) again to discuss all things GWs, future GW detectors, gravitation, relativity and, of course, some entertaining SciFi questions.
