title: Stargazing Event at Mt. Chareston
date: 2024-09-07 01:59:00
description: This summer, I was honored to be the guest speaker for the Las Vegas Astronomical Societyâ€™s stargazing event at the Spring Mountain Visitor Gateway at Mount Charleston. As a Las Vegas local, I fondly remember going to Mt. Charleston as a child for Girl Scout sleep-away camp, so I eagerly embraced the opportunity to discuss gravitational waves with other local families. Below are some photos and video of the event!
