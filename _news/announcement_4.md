I was featured as the guest speaker for the Las Vegas Astronomical Society's stargazing event which was featured on 8NewsNow: [Ever wondered what it’s like to stargaze at Mt. Charleston?](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/ever-wondered-what-its-like-to-stargaze-at-mt-charleston/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1ESbkGvxwMTtaLAJzkOvvSVEJ2-Uy2hUGG1BpWebR00FN8ZVgQdSNVyYc_aem_z-MNDMnG73OPicZlOOV0Rg)

The following month, I was invited back to present my research at LVAS monthly meeting: <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkeithcaceres314%2Fposts%2Fpfbid07kTUqxREHbKU5MZSxWF3FC1fFJ3LgT917MYu27e7SSTNb5byEgq4tPfsc6fGhpcwl&show_text=true&width=500" width="500" height="670" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
